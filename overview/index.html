    Here are a few key points about Vovinam martial program
  </h2>
  <p>
    Vovinam martial art program starts with training with kicks, punches and stances. More than 2 years of the program (light-blue to yellow belt) is dedicated training students to be efficient in execute the foundational moves. Altogether, there are about 120 techniques ranging from self-defence, arm lock to pressure point manipulation to be learnt for the blue belt. During that time, the body will develop in strength, endurance, toughness, reaction and flexibility. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Concurrent to the training of foundational techniques, the students will also be taught how to learn execute rolling and falling without hurting themselves. This can be intimidating as one may not be used to doing such. However once the techniques become instinctive, the students would be able to reduce/minimising the impact of falls on sparring mats and everyday life. An account told by one of our instructors describes how his bicycle got into a sudden stop when hit an obstacle. He was falling face first onto the concrete but due to his Vovinam training, he was able to execute the forward roll and walked away from it without a scratch.

    Once students reach their yellow belt (mid-range), which also is called instructor belts, the students will learn how to use weapons and disarm attackers with weapons. The weapons training program varies between different masters however they usually go in the order of dagger/knife, sword, long staff, sabre, ruler, axe, machete and riffle. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Vovinam’s weapon training is both comprehensive and in-depth. For example sword training has 15 basic sword techniques that train student to correctly use of the sword. Then are 15 counters which train the students how to react to sword attack. Then there are the sword forms: Tinh Hoa Luỡng Nghi Kiếm and Song Luyện Kiếm, which are practice individually and with partners respectively. These forms are used as simulations to sword fights to train adaptation and experience.

  <p>
    Another big part of Vovinam is wrestling which is derived from the Vietnam long tradition of wrestling. There are 28 wrestling techniques being taught from blue belts 2 stripes all the way to the red Belt or Master Belt. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The most famous Vovinam technique are the 21 đòn chân or leg techniques. This is a group of grappling techniques that is designed to grab the opponent using legs or feet. This can be used to take down opponent by using twisting motions of the body. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In conclusion, Vovinam is probably one of the most comprehensive martial programs. Many of people will train Vovinam well into their old age and still not master all the techniques. It is both compelling and humble experience in training Vovinam. It is compelling because for every techniques mastered there are even more challenging techniques to be learnt. It is humble because one will always be able to remain a student regardless of his belt.
